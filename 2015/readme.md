# Challenges for Year 2015

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!

- [Day 1: Not Quite Lisp](day-1)
- [Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math](day-2)
- [Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum](day-3)
